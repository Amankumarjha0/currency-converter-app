# currency-converter-app
I have developed a full functional currency converter app which changes all the money in true value
A simple and interactive currency converter web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app allows users to convert an amount from one currency to another using real-time exchange rates.
##Features
1.Convert multiple currencies including USD, EUR, GBP, etc.
2.Real-time exchange rate data fetched from an external API.
3.Simple, user-friendly interface.
4.Supports a variety of currencies.
5.Responsive design for use on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
##Technologies Used
HTML: Structure of the web page.
CSS: Styling and layout of the page.
JavaScript: Logic for fetching exchange rates and converting currencies.
##Clone Repositry
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/currency-converter.git
Usage
1.Select the base currency (the currency you want to convert from).
2.Select the target currency (the currency you want to convert to).
3.Enter the amount you want to convert in the input field.
4.The converted amount will be displayed automatically.
##API Integration
This project uses the ExchangeRate-API for real-time exchange rates. To ensure smooth functionality, an API key is required to make requests.

1.Sign up at ExchangeRate-API to get your free API key.
2.Update the JavaScript code in script.js with your API key.
javascript
const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY'; // Replace with your API key
